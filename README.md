# DaFitMatch

AI-assisted personal styling platform that helps users discover an aesthetic, profile their
preferences, and get explainable outfit recommendations — with a 3D avatar preview and virtual
try-on. Everything runs in the browser; there is no backend and no build step.

## Features

- **Aesthetic discovery wizard** (`aesthetic.html`) — an 8-step, no-login-required quiz that
  captures a structured style profile (aesthetics, colours, fit, formality, exclusions, priorities).
- **Recommendation engine** (`recommendations.html`) — deterministic, explainable ranking of the
  catalogue against the saved profile, with reasons, warnings and a per-criterion breakdown.
- **3D playground** (`index.html`) — three.js avatar viewer plus try-on preview (`#playground-area`).
- **Google Sign-In** (optional) — when configured, profiles persist per user; otherwise everything
  is stored locally for the guest.

## Quick start

Any static file server works. For example, with Python:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

> A local server is required (not `file://`) because the app fetches `src/data/catalogue.json`.

### Configuration

1. Copy the example config and fill in your Google OAuth client ID:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item src/config.example.js src/config.js
   ```

2. Add the serving origin (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`) to the OAuth client's
   **Authorised JavaScript origins** in the Google Cloud console.

`src/config.js` is git-ignored. Without a real client ID the app runs fine in guest mode and the
sign-in dialog reports that Google Sign-In is not configured.

## How it fits together

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data flow, the profile contract and how
the recommendation engine scores an outfit.

## Notes

- No frameworks, no bundler: plain HTML/CSS/Tailwind (CDN) and classic scripts.
- No personal data leaves the browser. Unavailable AI/product services are surfaced as
  "demo mode" — never as a successful live call.
